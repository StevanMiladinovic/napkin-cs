These are the source files for Stevan Miladinovic's _An Infinitely Large Napkin - Computer Science 
Edition_.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Evan Chen's [_An Infinitely Large Napkin_](https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin)

### Code

The project can be compiled on a system supporting `latexmk` and `asymptote`,
with a sufficiently recent version of TeX Live and biber.
Simply run `latexmk`.
