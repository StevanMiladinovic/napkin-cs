\chapter{Sets}\label{ch:sets}
\section{Definition}
\begin{definition}
  A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.
  We write sets surrounded by curly braces, with each element
  separated from the others by a comma.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  For example: \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) is the set
  containing the numbers one, two and three.
\end{example}

\section{Key Properties}
\begin{itemize}
  \ii{\textbf{Unordered:}} sets are unordered. That is, \(\{1,2,3\}=\{3,2,1\}\),
  because they contain the exact same elements, only in a different order.
  \ii{\textbf{No duplicates:}} sets only contain each element at most once.
  That is, \(\{1,2,3\}=\{1,2,2,3,3,3\}\), because they contain the same
  elements, only differing in \emph{how often} they occur.
\end{itemize}

\section{Membership}
A set may \emph{contain elements}.
To express that a given element \(x\) is contained within a set \(A\),
we write \(x \in A\). To express that an element \(y\) is \emph{not} contained
within a set \(A\), we write \(y \notin A\).

Two sets \(A, B\) are considered equal, precisely when
\((x \in A) \Leftrightarrow (x \in B)\) for all objects \(x\).

There exists a set that has no elements at all. It is called \emph{the empty
  set} and usually denoted as \(\emptyset\).
\(x \in \emptyset\) is a false statement for every possible object \(x\),
whereas \(x \notin \emptyset\) is true for every object \(x\).

\section{Describing Sets}
Sets may be described in a number of different ways.
The simplest method --- which we have used thus far --- is by simply listing out
all elements within the set.
However, this is only convenient for very small, and only possible at all for
\emph{finite} sets.
Infinite sets exist, however, and must be described using different means.
Consider, for instance, the set \(\mathbb{N}_{0} = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}\),
which contains all \emph{natural numbers}, starting at zero.
From this, we may construct further sets, such as
\(\mathbb{Z} = \{x-y \mid x, y \in \mathbb{N}_0\}\), which is the set of all
\emph{integers}.
From these, we can then further construct the set
\(\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{x}{y} \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z}, y \neq 0\}\) of all
\emph{rational numbers}.

Sets are central to virtually all branches of mathematics and theoretical
computer science. They provide the language in which most other concepts are
defined and formalized.

\section{Subsets and Powersets}

\section{Commonly Used Sets}
Commonly used sets include:
\begin{itemize}
  \ii{\(\mathbb{N}\):} The set of all \emph{natural numbers}
\begin{remark}
  The set \(\NN\) is sometimes understood to include \(0\), sometimes understood
  to not include it. This ambiguity is annoying.
  In this book, I shall always explicitly use \(\NN_{0}\) to denote the set of
  natural numbers \emph{including} zero and \(\NN^{*}\) to denote the set of
  natural numbers \emph{without} zero.
\end{remark}
  \ii{\(\mathbb{Z}\):} The set of all \emph{integers}
  \ii{\(\mathbb{Q}\):} The set of all \emph{rational numbers}
  \ii{\(\mathbb{R}\):} The set of all \emph{real numbers}
  \ii{\(\mathbb{C}\):} The set of all \emph{complex numbers}
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
  [Example Problem]
  Let \(A=\{0,1,2,3\}\). Is \(0 \in A\)?
  \begin{hint}
    Try reading the notation on sets.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{sol}
    Yes. Zero is an element of the set \(A\).
  \end{sol}
